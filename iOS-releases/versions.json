This includes updated versions of `proj`, `geos`,\n`spatialite`, `rttopo`, and other supporting open-source geospatial libraries.\nWe've also greatly enhanced the compilation pipeline for these libraries to be\nless brittle and enable more direct utilization of their functionality.\n\n:::caution\n\n### Missing `v2` functionality\n\nThis is a major overhaul of the app, and some features have not yet\nbeen completely reimplemented using new patterns. We anticipate fixing many problems\nand omissions in future minor versions in the `3.x` series.\n\nKey missing pieces:\n\n- Planetary projections are harder with `libproj` versions greater than 4, and have not been validated in the current version\n- Server connections with PostGIS need major upgrades and currently don't work.\n  :::\n",
