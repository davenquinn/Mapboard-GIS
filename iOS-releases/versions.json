The sidebar is now a floating panel,\nand the app can be freely rotated.\n\n### Map movement while editing\n\nWhen editing with a stylus, it is often useful to reposition the map between\nedits. However, touch types have proven difficult to separate. We've finally\nremoved this limitation, allowing easier map movement in all editing modes.\n\n:::note\nIf desired, separation between _Move_ and edit modes can be restored in **Project Settings**\n:::\n\n### Tile overlay improvements\n\n- A bug with loading map overlays were fixed, leading to\n  a more predictable experience when basemaps are loaded.\n- More layer visibility settings were made persistent\n- New warning messages were added for invalid MBTiles datasets and\n  those missing overviews.\n- The zoom range over which underscaled map overlays show up has\n  been increased.\n\n### User interface improvements\n\nWe made a ton of small improvements to the user interface:\n\n- Ensure the compass is never hidden behind the sidebar\n- Rearrange some settings for clarity\n- Make some forms more space-efficient\n- Make snap panel visible in _Reshape_ mode\n- Hide _Reshape_ tool for polygon editing\n- Add a scalebar\n- Add an experimental globe mode\n- Improve map loading indicators\n- Fix a small error in reported map scale\n- Disable map pitch when 3D mode is disabled\n\n### Editing bug fixes\n\nWe fixed many small bugs with editing features:\n\n- Fix snapping behavior for multipart lines\n- Improved _Topological erase_ tool to more correctly find\n  intersections; partial fix for repetition of lines.\n- Fix reshaping of multipart features\n- Fixes for larger datasets in Spatialite:\n  - Much quicker internal implementation for snapping\n  - Automatically split large features by number of\n    vertices for efficiency\n- Improve continuous update mode for topology (although\n  this still has a few notable bugs).\n- Improvements to internal threading model\n\nNow that the hard work of upgrading the fundamentals is done,\nwe're excited to be moving forward at a faster clip!\n",

This includes updated versions of `proj`, `geos`,\n`spatialite`, `rttopo`, and other supporting open-source geospatial libraries.\nWe've also greatly enhanced the compilation pipeline for these libraries to be\nless brittle and enable more direct utilization of their functionality.\n\n:::caution\n\n### Missing `v2` functionality\n\nThis is a major overhaul of the app, and some features have not yet\nbeen completely reimplemented using new patterns. We anticipate fixing many problems\nand omissions in future minor versions in the `3.x` series.\n\nKey missing pieces:\n\n- Planetary projections are harder with `libproj` versions greater than 4, and have not been validated in the current version\n- Server connections with PostGIS need major upgrades and currently don't work.\n  :::\n",
