All features will be rewritten, so use this capability with caution!\n\n### Planetary use\n\nBetter support for planetary (non-Earth) use by providing a pathway to add custom coordinate systems.\nCoordinate systems must be added to the `spatial_ref_sys` table in an external SQLite browser.\n\nAdd an optional `spheroid_radius` project configuration setting to adapt map scale reporting to different planetary bodies.\nThis configuration must be added directly to the project file, as such:\n\n```\nINSERT INTO mapboard_config\nVALUES ('spheriod_radius', 3396190);\n```",
