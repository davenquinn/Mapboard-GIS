version: 3.1.0
date: Unreleased

This is the first public release of the `3.x` series of **Mapboard GIS**.
It is a major rework of the app's internals and spatial editing capabilities,
in preparation for coming functional enhancements.

### Backend updates

**Mapboard GIS** is powered by open-source geospatial libraries, and its
software stack has been greatly enhanced in the `3.0` release.

### Potential pain points

Since this is a major overhaul of the app, some functionality was not
completely ported over for expediency. We anticipate fixing many problems
and omissions in future minor versions in the `3.x` series.
