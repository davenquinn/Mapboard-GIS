in-brief:
  - Fix project creation
  - Make some views auto-resizing

This release is a quick fix for several issues:

- A major regression that prevented the creation of new projects
- Make _3D Terrain_ the default setting to combat the lack of a functional "map idle"
  event when terrain is off.
- Fix a bug that prevented creation and editing of data types
- Several tiny bug fixes to map layout
