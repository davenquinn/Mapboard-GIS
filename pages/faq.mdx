## Does it replace a GIS system?

As its full name implies, Mapboard internally uses a sophisticated GIS system,
but it is not a fully realized system for managing geospatial data.

It prioritizes simple input over a fully realized set of tools. It also does not
have a system for managing feature attributes.

## Why?

Geologic maps are beautiful.

## Guiding principles

Mapboard GIS strongly follows the philosophy of a single app that does one thing well.
