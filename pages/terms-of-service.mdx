# Terms of service

**Mapboard GIS** is an application designed to help users with specific
geospatial tasks, and your use of the application is subject to the following
user agreement.

## Pricing and availability

We reserve the right to control the pricing and availability of the **Mapboard GIS**
application and its subscription services. Notably, we may change the price of
application services at our discretion. We may also remove subscription offerings and
cease listing the app with Apple without notice. We may change the requirements for
using the app in such a way as to exclude classes of devices that were formerly
eligible. We will make a reasonable effort to make sure such changes are not retroactive, but
this may not be possible in all circumstances.

## Your data

We do not assert any rights to the data you collect and organize with **Mapboard GIS**.
Application files and projects will remain under your control regardless of subscription
status and application availability. However, **Mapboard GIS** is not responsible
for any inaccuracy or inconsistency in your dataset, or for its continued accessibilty
or readability. It is your responsibility to ensure that your data is backed up and guard
against destructive changes, including those that originate in **Mapboard GIS**.

Privacy of your data and personal information is governed by the
[**Mapboard GIS** privacy policy](https://mapboard-gis.app/privacy).

## Third-party data and services

**Mapboard GIS** provides an interface to third-party data products and services
(e.g., [**Mapbox**](https://www.mapbox.com) basemaps and imagery). The application also
provides methods to connect to mapping servers on remote machines. Errors connecting to
or utilizing external servers are not the responsibilty of this app, nor is the integrity
and fidelity of externally provided data. Edits made to external databases through this app
are the responsibility of the user, not the app itself.

## Disclaimers

The services and the application are provided ‘as is’ without warranty of any
kind, express or implied, including, but not limited to, warranties of
performance, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, timeliness of
data transmission, accuracy of data or data sets, or uptime availability.
**Mapboard GIS** does not warrant that the application or the services will be free
from any bugs, errors, or omissions. **Mapboard GIS** specifically disclaims any
warranty as to the accuracy of any third-party data, and you acknowledge that
such third-party data is outside of **Mapboard GIS**’s control.
**Mapboard GIS** does not
warrant that the services will accomplish any of your specific objectives or
will operate without error. You agree that you will not hold
**Mapboard GIS** liable for any failure of the application or services or for any
loss of data. You agree that you will not hold **Mapboard GIS** liable for any
third-party information even if such information is displayed on, through, or
in connection with the application or software.
You also agree that **Mapboard GIS** shall not be responsible to you for any damages
caused by data provided by third parties, delays resulting from hardware and
systems owned and controlled by third parties (including without limitation
your own data transmission speeds), data entry errors, user errors, or any
other limitations, errors, or delays, that arise during the term of this
agreement that cannot be prevented or mitigated by **Mapboard GIS**.
