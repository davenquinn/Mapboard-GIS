# Features and comparisons

**Mapboard GIS** is difficult to measure against other field data-capture
apps, because it takes a totally different view of its task.
It is primarily designed to solve the (very hard) problem of quickly and
effectively capturing interpretations atop geospatial data. This task forms
the basis of geological mapping and other important tasks for geoscientists.

As the presence of "GIS" (for _geospatial information system_) in its name implies,
Mapboard relies on a sophisticated spatial engine â€” but it abandons the user interface
constraints of traditional GIS software.
In the spirit of its namesake tool, **Mapboard GIS** prioritizes a natural and
intuitive human interface for map editing
over a fully realized set of tools. It abandons precision GIS features such
as point-based editing operation in favor of novel tools geared to stylus editing,
such as quickly erasing and reshaping features. It also has path-breaking iterative topology
capabilities.

Unlike other field data capture apps, **Mapboard GIS** is cheifly focused on editing line and polygon data.
There are already many apps that support field sampling and measurement collection.
It is best used alongside an app like
[FieldMove](https://www.petex.com/products/move-suite/digital-field-mapping/),
[StraboSpot](https://www.strabospot.org/downloadapp),
[Rockd](https://rockd.org/), or another tool for capturing point data.

:::note
Right now, there is no way to see collected point data in **Mapboard GIS**.
We will work towards deepening integrations with outside platforms
for point data in a later iteration of the app.
:::

In order to function as a workable mapping application, **Mapboard GIS** supports
a standard set of baseline capabilities:

- Creation and editing of point and polygon features
- User-created data types
- Management of basemaps, including `mbtiles` tilesets
- Spatialite (onboard) and PostGIS (networked) database support

## Comparisons with other applications

<PageLinkButton href="/about/comparisons" className="big">**Comparisons table**</PageLinkButton>

[ArcGIS](https://www.arcgis.com),
[QGIS](https://www.qgis.org),
and [Global Mapper](https://www.bluemarblegeo.com/global-mapper/)
are the gold standard of GIS systems,
but they are only available for desktop-class devices and have only basic tools for pen-based editing.

If you want a fully featured GIS system for iPad specifically,
check out [**TouchGIS**](https://touchgis.app),
which is capable but expensive ($299/year). Its editing tools are simpler than desktop GIS
systems but still geared towards precision over speed. It lacks the natural drawing
capabilities of **Mapboard GIS**, but it has a lot of advanced capabilities that are out-of-scope
for this app (such as managing large collections of arbitrary layers and feature collection forms).

The editing capabilities of pen-centric apps such as [Procreate](https://procreate.art/)
and [GoodNotes](https://www.goodnotes.com/) serve as inspirations for **Mapboard GIS**.
These applications are (obviously) not mapping tools, but they serve as aspirational
models for how a tablet user interface should recede to the background behind strong
pen- and touch-based editing and simple tools.

Other applications that might be useful for collection of general field information
are [Input](https://inputapp.io/) and [QField](https://qfield.org/), both of which attempt to
integrate with QGIS.
