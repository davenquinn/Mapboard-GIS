# Version history

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [2.2.0] - 2021-03-19

- Fixed a bunch of prerelease bugs
- Make line certainty control dash pattern
- Add experimental geological symbols
- `.mapboard-project` files are now bare SQLite databases rather than packages.
  This allows direct opening in GIS software and database browsers.
- Many small UI fixes
- Deduplicated some frameworks

## [2.1.0] - 2020-11-27

### Changed

- Added the ability to show vertices and endpoints of the line layer (to diagnose topology problems)
- Added topology polygon layer that uses the same display interfaces as
  the line and polygon layers. This takes advances made for the onboard Spatialite
  backend and generalizes them to work with the PostGIS backend as well.
  Using this functionality requires shifting to the Version 2 series of
  the `mapboard-server` project.

## [2.0.1] - 2020-10-29

### Fixed

- Fixed showing and hiding of map layers and data types
- More functional topology control panel, now accessible
  directly from the polygons panel.

## [2.0.0] - 2020-10-20

### Added

- New topology mode for Spatialite backend

### Changed

- User interface rewritten in SwiftUI
- Moved to **Mapbox GL** for mapping backend
