# Roadmap

**Mapboard GIS** is an early-stage project and we are constantly adding new features.
Head to the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/davenquinn/Mapboard-GIS) to request a
new feature or improvement. If you've got a great idea and a plan to implement it,
we can discuss ways to integrate your effort into the application's codebase.

We are working on a publication to describe the app, it's companion topological tools,
and the iterative topology mapping technique. Stay tuned!

## Upcoming features

- A project initialization user interface that guides the user towards appropriate map projections

### Education-focused features

- Guidance on appropriate map projections
- Modes to predefine map area and allowed scale range for digitizing


- Integrations with Macrostrat (download current mapping as a start)
- Integrations of better mapping symbology (e.g. patterns)
