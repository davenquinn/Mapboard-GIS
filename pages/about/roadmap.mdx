## Upcoming features

- A project initialization user interface that guides the user towards appropriate map projections

### Education-focused features

- Guidance on appropriate map projections
- Modes to predefine map area and allowed scale range for digitizing

## Open to collaboration

Mapboard GIS is designed by and for Earth Science researchers, and we're hoping to be
good open-science citizens.

## Integration with other apps

Geologic fieldwork is a complex and multifaceted activity, and one application will
never fully capture researchers' needs. *Unbundling functionality and thinking carefully
about boundaries will workflows to be composed from multiple focused tools.* Mapboard
GIS hopes to eventually be part of an ecosystem of interoperable apps for mapping,
sample, orientation capture, structural analysis, and stratigraphic measurement.

- There are many apps for collection of geologic measurements and 

- In the last few years, iPadOS has markedly improved its file management capabilities.
  Mapboard GIS and other apps should be able to directly use files (particularly MBTiles basemaps)
  in each others' application folders or elsewhere on the device.
