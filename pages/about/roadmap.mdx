# Roadmap

**Mapboard GIS** is an early-stage project and we are constantly adding new features.
Head to the **Issue Tracker** to request a
new feature or improvement.

If you've got a great idea and a plan to implement it,
we can discuss ways to integrate your effort into the application's codebase.
Feel free to [contact us directly](mailto:dev@davenquinn.com) as well.

:::note
We are working on a publication to describe the app, it's companion topological tools,
and the iterative topology mapping technique. Stay tuned!

## Potential upcoming features

- A layer for text notes and schematic drawings on the map
- Ability to capture and edit sample locations  
  _This is a potential integration point with other apps._
- Some sort of GeoPDF basemap support
- A quicker onboard topology engine
- Some level of support for the [GeoPackage](https://www.geopackage.org/) format,
  which is similar to the Spatialite format that currently drives the map

### Education-focused features

- A project initialization user interface that guides
  the user towards appropriate map projections
- Modes to predefine map area and allowed scale range for digitizing
- A "simple" user-interface mode that hides features for map production

### Integrations with outside systems

- Integration with Macrostrat (download current mapping as a starting point)
- Improved mapping symbology (e.g. patterns)
- Sharing data between the Spatialite (offline) and PostGIS (tethered) modes
