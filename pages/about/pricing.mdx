# Pricing and evaluation

**Mapboard GIS** uses a subscription pricing model. The base application
is free, but most users will want a **Full Version** subscription which
costs $29.99 per year[^1], billed through Apple's App Store.

## Why a subscription?

Our motivations in releasing **Mapboard GIS** are to save time
for other researchers and to model a new relationship between geoscientists
and their computing tools. However, charging for a subscription will allow us to
build a more smoothly functional tool, and our pricing compares well with
[the competition](https://touchgis.app).

Building iOS software, keeping it up-to-date, and sharing it with the
community requires tons of effort.
Looking at the experiences of other tools such as 
[FieldMove](https://www.petex.com/products/move-suite/digital-field-mapping/),
free or even one-time purchase software runs the risk of abandonment
due to uncompensated effort. Plus, it costs real money to list
the application with Apple and
build atop the world-beating [Mapbox](https://mapbox.com)
mapping stack. The charge will help defray these costs.

It remains to be seen whether charging for the use of this product
will allow its development to be sustained, or whether new approaches
(e.g., seeking grant funding) will need to be tried. But we're confident
that this project saves enough time to be worth what we're asking.


## Limitations of the demo mode


## Development and testing

Researcher are encouraged to contribute to the application,
by working with us to add features or integrate the app into the community.
We are very interested in supporting the app's use in educational settings and
professional map production.
At the very least, such work will be compensated with free access to the software.

Testing pre-release versions of the software is a great way to help out.
Through **TestFlight** you can work with the full version of the application
at no charge, although builds can be less stable and expire after 90 days.
