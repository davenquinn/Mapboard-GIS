# Pricing and evaluation

**Mapboard GIS** uses a subscription pricing model. The base application
is free, but most users will want a <u>**Full Version**</u> subscription which
costs **$29.99 per year** (or your local currency equivalent), billed through Apple's App Store.

## Limitations of the free version

The free version of the app gives access to all functionality, but with a
limitation to **50 editing operations per day**. On the trial, you can easily
test drawing features, adding custom basemaps, connecting to remote servers,
and sharing your results to GIS software. Although data creation is limited,
it's easy to try out the app and get a sense of whether the workflow will fit
your needs.

## Why a subscription?

Our motivations in releasing **Mapboard GIS** are to save time
for other researchers and to model a new relationship between geoscientists
and their computing tools. Charging for a subscription will allow us to
build a more smoothly functional tool, and our pricing compares well with
[the competition](https://touchgis.app).

Building iOS software, keeping it up-to-date, and sharing it with the
community requires tons of effort.
The lifecycle of other tools such as 
[FieldMove](https://www.petex.com/products/move-suite/digital-field-mapping/)
suggests that free or even single-purchase software risks abandonment
due to uncompensated effort. Plus, it costs real money to list
the application with Apple and
build atop the world-beating [Mapbox](https://mapbox.com)
mapping stack. The **Full Version** subscription will help defray these
costs, and we're confident
that this project saves enough time to be worth the asking price. 

<!--
It remains to be seen whether charging for the use of this product
will allow its development to be sustained, or whether new approaches
(e.g., seeking grant funding) will need to be tried. But we're confident
that this project saves enough time to be worth what we're asking.

## Development and testing

We're excited to work with geoscience researchers to improve and integrate this mapping system.
There are several pathways to use the app for free if you are collaborating with us.

### Testing

Testing pre-release versions of the software is a great way to help out with
development. Through **TestFlight** you can work with the full version of the
application at no charge, although builds can be less stable and expire after
90 days. We appreciate feedback on our pre-release code.

### Developing integrations

The approach taken by this app and [PostGIS Geologic Map](https://github.com/davenquinn/PostGIS-Geologic-Map)
has the potential to greatly simplify mapping workflows, but building these processes takes
time and effort. We're excited to support
the system's use in educational settings and professional map production.
Please [get in touch](mailto:dev@davenquinn.com) if you'd like to use the app
in an organized way, and we can make a plan for how to proceed.

### Code-level contributions

If you have feature ideas and are interested in working with us to
implement them, we're open to giving access to contribute to the app. If this
discussion arises, we will think about options for
[open-sourcing](/about/interop#open-source) part or all of the codebase.
We're also willing to spin out parts of our system as open-source libraries
if it will contribute concretely to other projects.
