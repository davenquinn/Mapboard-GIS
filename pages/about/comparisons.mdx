- ArcGIS and QGIS are the gold standard of GIS systems, but they are only available for
  desktop-class devices and have poor tools for pen-based editing.
- TouchGIS provides a ton of capabilities for iPad mapping but is expensive ($299/year).
  Its editing tools are simpler than desktop GIS systems but still geared towards precision
  over speed.
- Procreate and GoodNotes are effective interfaces for drawing and note-taking. Although they
  lack mapping capabilities, they serve as aspirational models for how a tablet user
  interface should recede to the background.

It is best used alongside an app like [FieldMove] or [StraboSpot] for capturing point data.

be opened natively in desktop GIS environments such as ArcGIS or QGIS.
