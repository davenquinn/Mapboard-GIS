# Openness and interoperability

**Mapboard GIS** is designed by and for Earth Science researchers, and we're
hoping to be good open-science citizens. We are trying to build a focused
tool which fundamentally rethinks one small part of the complex process of
mapmaking in the geosciences. An important aspect of working on a targeted
tool is forging strong links with other parts of the process, and
accordingly, we want to make it as easy as possible to share data between
systems.

<!--
_Unbundling functionality and thinking carefully
about boundaries will allow workflows to be composed from multiple focused tools._
Crucially, putting different pieces of workflows in the hands of researchers who care
the most about specific aspects will allow more attention to detail on creating
effective and easy-to-use human interfaces.
-->

We support an open system chiefly by using
industry-standard, open-source formats for data storage
and maintaining direct links to desktop GIS systems.

## Open spatial database formats

The `.mapboard-project` files that back the app are
[Spatialite](https://www.gaia-gis.it/fossil/libspatialite/index) databases can be directly read by
standard GIS systems (e.g., ArcGIS and QGIS). Metadata can be edited in
database browser applications such as [SQLite Browser](https://sqlitebrowser.org/).

## Direct links to desktop GIS

In [tethered mode](/docs/tethered-mode), data streams directly from **Mapboard GIS**
into PostGIS, where it can accessed by other systems immediately upon creation.

Since Mapboard works directly with spatial databases, no data import or export is needed
for interoperability.
This simplifies the app and allows it to work smoothly in concert with desktop GIS.
Conversely, producing specific output formats like Shapefiles[^1] requires
transformation using desktop GIS packages.

## Next steps

### On-device integration with other field apps

Geologic fieldwork is a complex and multifaceted activity, and one application will
never fully capture researchers' needs.
There are many apps for capturing point-data measurements and outcrop images,
for instance, and **Mapboard GIS** gains little from reimplementing that
aspect of field workflows.

Eventually, we hope **Mapboard GIS** will become part of an ecosystem
of interoperable apps for mapping, sampling, orientation capture,
structural analysis, and stratigraphic measurement.
This has been difficult to achieve on mobile platforms so far.
However, in the last few years, Apple's iPadOS platform has grown up
somewhat to allow more multitasking capabilities, making the way forward
a bit easier to imagine. For instance, with the recent opening of the
iPad's file-management capabilities,
Mapboard GIS and other apps should be able to directly use
files (particularly MBTiles basemaps) in each others' application folders or elsewhere on the device.

<h3 id="open-source">Thoughts on open-source</h3>

**Mapboard GIS** is not (currently) open-source software. We understand
the value of free software to open science, but we think that keeping our
work close is a useful precaution right now. Building embedded systems
is difficult and time-consuming, and we've seen relatively few iOS apps
that have successfully built sustainable open-source models at this point.

We believe that **Mapboard GIS** can serve the goals of open science even as closed-source,
subscription-based software.
Since we rely on [open file formats](/docs/project-file) for data storage,
the app will be at home within open-source workflows.
Also, both the [**PostGIS Geologic Map**](https://github.com/davenquinn/PostGIS-Geologic-Map)
project, the reference implementation for our iterative topology workflow,
and the **Mapboard GIS** [server components](https://github.com/davenquinn/Mapboard-Server)
are open-source. These can potentially be
customized to link the app with other projects as needed.

The **Mapboard GIS** codebase is structured to allow opening it in the
future, should the requirements or our ability to support the project change.
We're open to adjusting our pricing model and management strategy going
forward, especially if opportunities for code-level collaboration arise. Feel
free to [contact us](mailto:dev@davenquinn.com) with questions, concerns, or
suggestions about our approach.
