# Openness and interoperability

Mapboard GIS is designed by and for Earth Science researchers, and we're
hoping to be good open-science citizens. We want to support

## Integration with other apps

Geologic fieldwork is a complex and multifaceted activity, and one application will
never fully capture researchers' needs. *Unbundling functionality and thinking carefully
about boundaries will allow workflows to be composed from multiple focused tools.* Mapboard
GIS hopes to eventually be part of an ecosystem of interoperable apps for mapping,
sample, orientation capture, structural analysis, and stratigraphic measurement.

- There are many apps for collection of geologic measurements and 

- In the last few years, iPadOS has markedly improved its file management capabilities.
  Mapboard GIS and other apps should be able to directly use files (particularly MBTiles basemaps)
  in each others' application folders or elsewhere on the device.
 
## Thoughts on open-source

**Mapboard GIS** is currently *not* open-source software. We understand
the value of free software to open science, but we think that keeping our
work close is a useful precaution. Building embedded systems
is difficult and time-consuming, and there are relatively few iOS apps
that have successfully built sustainable open-source models at this stage.

We believe we can serve the goals of open science even as closed-source,
subscription-based software. However, we're open to adjusting our pricing model
and management strategy going forward. We're also maintaining our codebase
with an eye towards opening it in the future, should the requirements or
our ability to support the project change. 

Both the [**PostGIS Geologic Map**](https://github.com/davenquinn/PostGIS-Geologic-Map)
topology watcher (the foundational methodological advance that anchors this project)
and the [server components](https://github.com/davenquinn/Mapboard-Server)
that connect to **Mapboard GIS** are open-source components.
This, along with our reliance on [open file formats](/docs/project-file) for
on-device storage, ensures that
the app will be at home within open-source workflows.

If you have questions, concerns,
or suggestions about our approach in this regard,
