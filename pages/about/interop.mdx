# Openness and interoperability

**Mapboard GIS** is designed by and for Earth Science researchers, and we're
hoping to be good open-science citizens. In improving mapping processes,
we want to make it as easy as possible to share data between systems.

## Direct links with desktop GIS

We maintain an open system chiefly by using industry-standard formats for data storage.
The Spatialite database files that back the app can be directly read by
standard GIS systems (e.g., ArcGIS and QGIS), and metadata can be edited in
database browser applications such as [SQLite Browser](https://sqlitebrowser.org/).
In [tethered mode](/docs/tethered-mode), data streams directly into PostGIS,
where it can accessed by other systems immediately upon creation.

Since Mapboard works directly with spatial databases, no data import or export is needed.
This simplifies the app, but makes it less useful without preparation using desktop GIS.
Producing specific formats like Shapefiles[^1] requires transformation using desktop
GIS packages. Likewise, to insert your own basemap into Mapboard GIS, you will need
to provide tiled data yourself.

## Next steps

### Smooth integration with other field apps

Geologic fieldwork is a complex and multifaceted activity, and one application will
never fully capture researchers' needs.
There are many apps for capturing point-data measurements and outcrop images,
for instance, and **Mapboard GIS** gains little from reimplementing that
aspect of field workflows.

*Unbundling functionality and thinking carefully
about boundaries will allow workflows to be composed from multiple focused tools.*
Crucially, putting different pieces of workflows in the hands of researchers who care
the most about specific aspects will allow more attention to detail on creating
effective and easy-to-use human interfaces.

Eventually, we hope **Mapboard GIS** will become part of an ecosystem
of interoperable apps for mapping, sampling, orientation capture,
structural analysis, and stratigraphic measurement.
This has been difficult to achieve on mobile platforms so far.
However, in the last few years, Apple's iPadOS platform has grown up
somewhat to allow more multitasking capabilities, making the way forward
a bit easier to imagine. For instance, with the recent opening of the
iPad's file-management capabilities,
Mapboard GIS and other apps should be able to directly use
files (particularly MBTiles basemaps) in each others' application folders or elsewhere on the device.
 
<h3 id="open-source">Thoughts on open-source</h3>

**Mapboard GIS** is currently *not* open-source software. We understand
the value of free software to open science, but we think that keeping our
work close is a useful precaution right now. Building embedded systems
is difficult and time-consuming, and we've seen relatively few iOS apps
that have successfully built sustainable open-source models at this point.

We believe we can serve the goals of open science even as closed-source,
subscription-based software. However, we're open to adjusting our pricing model
and management strategy going forward, especially if opportunities for code-level
collaboration arise. We're maintaining our codebase
with an eye towards opening it in the future, should the requirements or
our ability to support the project change. 

The app will be at home within open-source workflows:
we rely on [open file formats](/docs/project-file) for data storage.
The [**PostGIS Geologic Map**](https://github.com/davenquinn/PostGIS-Geologic-Map)
project, the reference implementation for our iterative topology workflow, is open-source.
The [server components](https://github.com/davenquinn/Mapboard-Server)
that connect to **Mapboard GIS** are also open-source, allowing customized
links to other projects.

Feel free to [contact us](mailto:dev@davenquinn.com) with questions, concerns,
or suggestions about our approach in this regard.
