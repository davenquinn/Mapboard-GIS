# Motivation and design

**Mapboard GIS** is an iPad mapping system for drawing geospatial
information into a spatial database. It works both in a standalone,
field-ready mode and as a tethered client, with a paired desktop or
laptop handling geospatial operations.

Somewhat weirdly for a geoscientist, my senior year of college, I took
a class on **INLS 318: Human-Computer Interaction**. This course made a
huge impression on me. Frustrations we have with digital processes are
often just boil down to poorly designed interfaces between user and machine. 

Now when I see an imperfect digital process,
I have the urge to examine the process and try to find a better way.
Mapping is ripe for this kind of disruption â€” researchers' capabilities
are being limited by over-proscriptive computer systems, and much of the
problem is at the human-computer interface.

Now, I've elegantly solved my problem. So we've reached the second phase
of this exercise, where I see if this change in approach can transform
others' workflows as much as it has improved mine.
