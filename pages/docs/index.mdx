# Getting started

When you install and open **Mapboard GIS**, you will see the main screen.
You then have the opportunity to create a new project
or load a basic example.

New projects are added to the project list and made available as
[`mapboard-project` files](/docs/project-file) in the **Files** app.
Existing projects can be added to the list
by placing them in the **Mapboard GIS** documents folder.

Swiping left shows the application settings panel, which manages basic application-wide settings
and the [Full Version subscription](/about/pricing).
