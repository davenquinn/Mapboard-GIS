# Getting started

When you install and open **Mapboard GIS**, you will see the main screen.
Swiping left will show application settings. You can also create a new project
or load a basic example.

Projects you create will be added to the project list. They will also be available as
[`mapboard-project` files](/docs/project-file) in the **Files** app. Existing projects can be added to the list
by placing them in the **Mapboard GIS** documents folder.

The application settings panel provides control over basic application-wide settings
and allows management of the [Full Version subscription](/about/pricing).
