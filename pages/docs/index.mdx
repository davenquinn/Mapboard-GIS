# User Guide

**Mapboard GIS** is an iPad mapping system for drawing geospatial
information into a spatial database. It works both in a standalone,
field-ready mode and as a tethered client, with a paired desktop or
laptop handling geospatial operations.

Field geological mapping can be a data-management headache, and capturing high-quality geospatial
information over a large mapping project is tricky.
**Mapboard GIS** allows quick and natural capture of mapping data
into user-defined line and polygon
types using the Apple Pencil, with a process flow comparable to working atop a
paper map. Data are saved to an industry-standard open-source spatial database:
_Spatialite_ in "field" mode or _PostGIS_ a on networked server in "tethered" mode.
Both of these data collections can be opened by standard **QGIS** or **ArcGIS**
desktop GIS software (ArcGIS can only connect to PostGIS in read-only mode); the PostGIS
backend additionally supports advanced collaborative mapping.

Custom tile layers including `MBTiles` files can be loaded
for field-accessible basemaps. Multiple projects can be managed on the same device
and shared with other devices. Mapping can be done in arbitrary spatial reference
systems.


## Does it replace a GIS system?

As its full name implies, Mapboard internally uses a sophisticated GIS system,
but it is not a fully realized system for managing geospatial data.

It prioritizes simple input over a fully realized set of tools. It also does not
have a system for managing feature attributes.

## Why?

Geologic maps are beautiful.
