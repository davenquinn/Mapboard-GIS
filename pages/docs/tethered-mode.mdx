# Tethering to PostGIS

<Figure src="/docs/tethered-mode.jpg" className="full">Working with large datasets in PostGIS</Figure>

In _Tethered mode_, **Mapboard GIS** can turn over all spatial processing
functionality to a centralized [**PostGIS**](https://postgis.net/) database.
PostGIS is an extremely popular and widespread open-source spatial database
system that can be used within most modern GIS applications.

>With its <a href="">server extensions</a>, <strong>Mapboard GIS</strong> can
connect to a <strong>PostGIS</strong> database alongside desktop GIS software.</Figure>

Offloading spatial operations to a server-side database has several advantages:

- It enables work against much larger datasets than an iPad can handle locally.
- It allows real-time interoperability with other GIS systems (e.g. drawing in
  **Mapboard GIS** can be paired with data cleaning in **QGIS**)
- It allows _collaborative mapping_, with multiple iPads tethered to the same spatial database.

## The core spatial server

Topological functions are not required for a basic connection to PostGIS.
In its simplest form,
_Tethered mode_ requires a connection to a networked server running
[Mapboard's server extensions](https://github.com/davenquinn/mapboard-server),
or another server implementing the same external interface.

This server relies on a simple schema of four spatial tables
within a PostGIS database: `linework`, `linework_type`, `polygon`, and `polygon_type`.
These are the same core tables that drive the **Spatialite** backend (see [file format docs](/docs/projects/file-format)). These tables
can be housed in any schema, but we use `map_digitizer` by default.

:::note
The correspondence between **PostGIS** and **Spatialite** table structure will
eventually be expanded to drive "hybrid" workflows with managed syncing from
offline mapping back into a broader project.

## PostGIS with managed topology

The most robust way to run a fully featured mapping server for work with
**Mapboard GIS** is to use the
[**PostGIS Geologic Map**](https://github.com/davenquinn/PostGIS-Geologic-Map) topology
watcher. This software manages the topology of a geologic map iteratively,
**independent of the choice of GIS platform for making edits**.

  <strong>PostGIS Geologic Map</strong> enables iterative topological solving
  against the server-side data store for <strong>Mapboard GIS</strong> data.
</Figure>

**PostGIS Geologic Map** is designed to be testable, validated, and performant, and it serves as the
basis for advanced topological operations within **Mapboard GIS**.
Although the solver is agnostic to input GIS environment,
the Mapboard server extensions are bundled by default.

**PostGIS Geologic Map** adds to the `map_digitizer` schema that tracks core map
edits with a `map_topology` schema that organizes the solved topological relationships
that make up the map. This schema can be regenerated at will, but progressively updating
its tables serves as the basis for the iterative map editing showcased in **Mapboard GIS**.

:::note
The algorithms that drive **PostGIS Geologic Map** are a key component of a draft manuscript
that discusses the new methodology being developed here. Updates will come soon!

### Installing the server components

Since both [**PostGIS Geologic Map**](https://github.com/davenquinn/PostGIS-Geologic-Map) (preferred) and the
core [Mapboard server extensions](https://github.com/davenquinn/mapboard-server) are server-side software,
installing and connecting to them can be difficult. Both projects can be built from source by downloading the
code from GitHub. Both can be installed locally or using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to manage the containerized app, including
the requisite database server.

For **PostGIS Geologic Map**, the preferred server implementation, installation is well-covered in
[the README](https://github.com/davenquinn/postgis-geologic-map#installation). The gist of creating a Docker-managed build
(with test data) is as follows:

1. Make sure Docker and `docker-compose` are installed using the
   [instructions for your platform](https://docs.docker.com/install/).
2. Modify the `docker-assets/docker-map-config.json` configuration file to suit
   your needs (typically, this involves changing the `srid` and `tolerance` fields).
   A better way to configure the application in Docker is forthcoming.
3. Run `docker-compose up --build`. No need for a local PostgreSQL installation!
4. Connect to the `geologic_map` database on local port `54321` using your GIS software
   or database client.

</figure>

Once you've started the application, the Mapboard server should be running locally on your computer.
By default, the server is exposed on port `3006`. You can verify this by navigating to `http://localhost:3006/meta` in your
browser. You should see a REST API response much like the one below:

This means you've successfully installed the Mapboard server! If you're using the server without the **PostGIS Geologic Map** extensions,
the `capabilities` array will contain fewer entries. This tells **Mapboard GIS** to disable the corresponding functionality.

### Connecting

The next step is _connecting_ to the server from **Mapboard GIS**. If you are running the application on a publicly addressable machine,
the server will be available at `<your-server-address>:3006`. Otherwise you have to find your IP address or local network address.
On **MacOS** this is done in the **Sharing** panel of **System Preferences**. Alternatively, the raw IP address can be found using
the command `ipconfig getifaddr en0`
(on Mac and Linux platforms). Windows users, you're on your own for now, sorry!

<Figure

>The local network address for my machine is <code>Daven-Quinn.local</code>.
  This is an alias for IP address <code>192.168.1.100</code>, which changes as
  my local router allocates IP addresses.</Figure>

Once you have the proper connection string (e.g., `Daven-Quinn.local:3006`), you can connect in **Mapboard GIS** at the project
creation/editing interface. When the project is loaded, the app will begin talking to the server at that address to load linework and
handle editing.
