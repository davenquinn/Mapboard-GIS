# Reporting bugs

**Mapboard GIS** is early-stage software, and we anticipate that many bugs will be discovered as the app enters broad use.
We also expect that the app will fit awkwardly into some use cases, requiring new features that we did not initially
plan for. We're excited to hear all manner of input!

Bugs and feature requests can be reported on the **Issue Tracker** for the **Mapboard GIS** repository.

If you'd like to ask about a specific use case or integration, don't hesitate
to [contact us directly](mailto:dev@davenquinn.com). We're excited to collaborate to
push the state of mapping forward!
