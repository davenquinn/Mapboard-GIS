**Mapboard GIS** includes a wide variety of [Mapbox basemaps](https://www.mapbox.com/maps)
to contextualize mapping.
Additionally, `mbtiles`-formatted basemaps and streaming imagery can be added,
allowing a wide range of map imagery to be used in the application.

:::note
Caching of tiles from Mapbox's servers will be supported a later version of the app.

## Creating basemaps

The most common way to get outside imagery into **Mapboard GIS**
is to convert it to a **MBTiles** basemap.
MBTiles is a pre-tiled imagery format where imagery for different zoom levels is stored in a SQLite
database (see [the spec](https://github.com/mapbox/mbtiles-spec/blob/master/1.3/spec.md)).
It is easy to consume on mobile devices with relatively little overhead. However, because
it's not a traditional GIS format, it must typically be
prepared by the user. There are a few options:

- [**QGIS**](https://docs.qgis.org/3.16/en/docs/user_manual/managing_data_source/create_layers.html?highlight=mbtiles#creating-new-layers-from-an-existing-layer)
  can create `mbtiles` files from existing raster layers.
- The commercial [MapTiler](https://www.maptiler.com/s) package can be used to generate MBTiles
  datasets from imagery sources including GeoPDFs (see [this help page](https://support.maptiler.com/i62-geospatial-pdf)).
- The [RasterIO MBTiles extension](https://github.com/mapbox/rio-mbtiles) allows the creation of
  MBTiles files from most raster imagery.
- [**GDAL**](https://gdal.org/drivers/raster/mbtiles.html) can be used to create a MBTiles file using the
  `gdal_warp`, `gdal_translate`, and `gdaladdo` utilities.

A generic recipe for MBTiles preparation with GDAL:

```sh
gdal_translate -expand rgba input.tif step1.tif
gdalwarp -t_srs EPSG:3857 step1.tif step2.tif
gdal_translate -of mbtiles step2.tif output.mbtiles
gdaladdo output.mbtiles 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256
```
