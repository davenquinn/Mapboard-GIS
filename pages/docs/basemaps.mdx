**Mapboard GIS** includes a variety of [Mapbox basemaps](https://www.mapbox.com/maps)
to contextualize mapping.
Additionally, `mbtiles`-formatted basemaps and streaming imagery can be added,
allowing a wide range of map imagery to be used in the application.

## Caching Mapbox tilesets

<Figure src="/docs/basemaps/offline-tilesets.jpg" width={280} className="right"
>Cached basemap management interface</Figure>

As of version `2.3.0`, **Mapboard GIS** can cache tilesets from Mapbox's servers.
The _Manage offline tilesets_ panel can be invoked from the _Tile layers_ selection
page. Pressing the _+_ button at the top of this panel starts the process of downloading
an offline tileset. Previously created tilesets are listed in this panel and can be deleted
with contextual actions. Tilesets are shared between projects and limited to Mapbox-provided
basemap layers.

:::warning
The user interface for this feature is very basic and will be improved in a future release.

## Creating basemaps

>The form for adding a new tile layer to the map</Figure>

The most common way to get outside imagery into **Mapboard GIS**
is to convert it to a **MBTiles** basemap.
MBTiles is a pre-tiled imagery format where imagery for different zoom levels is stored in a SQLite
database (see [the spec](https://github.com/mapbox/mbtiles-spec/blob/master/1.3/spec.md)).
It is easy to consume on mobile devices with relatively little overhead. However, because
it's not a traditional GIS format, it must typically be
prepared by the user. There are a few options:

- [**QGIS**](https://docs.qgis.org/3.16/en/docs/user_manual/managing_data_source/create_layers.html?highlight=mbtiles#creating-new-layers-from-an-existing-layer)
  can create `mbtiles` files from existing raster layers.
- The commercial [MapTiler](https://www.maptiler.com/s) package can be used to generate MBTiles
  datasets from imagery sources including GeoPDFs (see [this help page](https://support.maptiler.com/i62-geospatial-pdf)).
- The [RasterIO MBTiles extension](https://github.com/mapbox/rio-mbtiles) allows the creation of
  MBTiles files from most raster imagery.
- [**GDAL**](https://gdal.org/drivers/raster/mbtiles.html) can be used to create a MBTiles file using the
  `gdal_warp`, `gdal_translate`, and `gdaladdo` utilities.

A generic recipe for MBTiles preparation with GDAL:

```sh
gdal_translate -expand rgba input.tif step1.tif
gdalwarp -t_srs EPSG:3857 step1.tif step2.tif
gdal_translate -of mbtiles step2.tif output.mbtiles
gdaladdo output.mbtiles 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256
```
