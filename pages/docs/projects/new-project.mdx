# Project creation options

  The project-creation interface
</Figure>

The new project interface allows several categories of new information to be
captured to set up a new mapping project. The top _Project details_ section
manages basic metadata.

The _Backend_ section allows the selection of the spatial backend.
There are three available backends: the standalone _Spatialite_ GIS engine, the tethered
_PostGIS_ engine, and the _Image_ backend.

The default **Spatialite** backend stores geospatial information directly in
a database on the iPad, for easy use in offline scenarios (especially the field). This
backend is mostly feature-complete, but many spatial operations
(especially topology) are relatively slow. This makes it a poor choice for large mapping
projects. Work is ongoing to remove some of these limitations, especially as the
capabilities of iOS devices improve.

## Choosing a spatial reference frame

The choice of spatial reference frame is important in all GIS applications, and
**Mapboard GIS** has full support for the wide variety of spatial reference systems
in common use. Reference systems prioritize validity and accuracy for
different use cases and parts of the world (the Spatialite documentation has a good
[primer](https://www.gaia-gis.it/gaia-sins/spatialite-cookbook/html/srid.html)).

:::note
We are working on a helper to set the "correct" SRID for typical regional mapping projects.
However, until this is finished, you must find and set the SRID yourself.
:::

The default spatial reference, [SRID `4326`](https://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/4326/),
longitude/latitude relative to the WGS84 datum, is acceptable globally, but using a more
locally-relevant datum can improve the speed and accuracy of GIS calculations. For
instance, a [UTM projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Transverse_Mercator_coordinate_system)
is the standard for many regional and local applications.

## The _PostGIS_ backend

With the **PostGIS** backend, the application talks to a remote server (usually
on a local network, although in principle internet locations can also be used),
where all spatial operations are handled. This enables faster processing,
data security, and collaborative mapping.

:::note
In PostGIS mode, spatial reference information and feature classes are managed on the
server, so they are not configured within the app.

## The _Image_ backend

The **Image** backend is a stripped-down version of
**Spatialite** mode that supports digitization atop a static image in
pixel coordinates. This can help support processes such as annotating field
images for later feature extraction from 3D models.

:::note
Some presently unwieldy aspects of the image mode, such as the restriction to
a single image per project, may be addressed in future updates.
