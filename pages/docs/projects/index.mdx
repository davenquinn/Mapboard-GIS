# Project management

<Figure

  width={300}
  className="right">**Mapboard**'s project file list</Figure>

The main screen of **Mapboard GIS** shows a list of available projects.
Entries in the list correspond to [`mapboard-project` files](/docs/project-file)
in the **Mapboard GIS** documents folder.

Selecting a project in the project list brings up the [map interface](/docs/map-interface)
for that project, which will remain active until the project is closed.

The same set of project files can also be accessed through the **Files** app,
which allows moving, sharing and archiving projects.

className="center">Project files in the <strong>Files</strong>
  app. Also note the 18 GB [`mbtiles` cached basemap](/docs/basemaps)!</Figure>

When attached to a
computer, Finder (Mac) or iTunes file sharing (Windows) can also be used
for file transfers. This is particularly valuable when transferring large
files such as [basemap imagery](/docs/basemaps).

## Creating new projects

## Editing and sharing projects

At the project list, dragging an individual project card to the left exposes
actions for editing, deleting, and exporting that project.

- The **Export** button opens a standard iOS _Share Sheet_, allowing
  projects to be copied outside of the app. One common operation
  is to transfer the files to another device with _AirDrop_. This is especially
  useful for quick backups or opening the project in desktop GIS programs.
- The **Edit** button opens the project-creation interface for modifying
  metadata for an existing project. The project's backend cannot be modified,
  with one exception: the server
  URL for a [_PostGIS_ tethered backend](/docs/tethered-mode) can be adjusted.
