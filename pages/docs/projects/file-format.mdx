# Project file format

**Mapboard GIS** stores all project information within a
[Spatialite](https://www.gaia-gis.it/fossil/libspatialite/index) database.
Spatialite is the spatial extension to SQLite,
a small but capable database engine used by [_literally everyone_](https://www.sqlite.org/mostdeployed.html).
This open-source, well-documented basis allows project files to be created, read, and
modified by outside software. Importantly, Spatialite files are supported natively by
[QGIS](https://docs.qgis.org/3.16/en/docs/training_manual/databases/spatialite.html),
[ArcGIS](https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/manage-data/databases/sqlite-and-arcgis.htm),
and [Global Mapper](https://www.bluemarblegeo.com/knowledgebase/global-mapper-19/Formats/Spatial_Database_Import_Options.htm),
among other geospatial desktop environments. This means that there can always be
a seamless transition between iPad and desktop mapping.

:::note
The `.mapboard-project` format is designed to support onboard spatial processing.
Although the same file format is used for projects operating in
[_Tethered mode_](/docs/tethered-mode), the GIS capabilities of Spatialite
are not used. Instead, all spatial information is stored in a remote
**PostGIS** database. However, the layout of spatial tables
remains [much the same](https://github.com/davenquinn/mapboard-server/tree/master/db-fixtures/create-tables.sql).

## Internal design

Using a SQLite-based format for data storage, including for subsidiary
information beyond the core spatial tables, results in a format that is
self-documenting and extensible. This strategy for building app files is
advocated by the [SQLite project](https://www.sqlite.org/appfileformat.html).
The file must have the extension `.mapboard-project` to be recognized as a
Mapboard project.

The `.mapboard-project` format can be read by a variety of software for working with SQLite
databases, including graphical applications such as [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/) (_recommended_)
and [**SQLite Studio**](https://sqlitestudio.pl/). The [**Spatialite GUI** application](https://www.gaia-gis.it/fossil/spatialite_gui/index)
can open the spatial tables in the app. The file format can also be read using the
[`sqlite3` command-line application](https://sqlite.org/cli.html) and libraries for all major programming languages.

The project file structure is anchored by several key tables:
`linework`, `linework_type`, `polygon`, and `polygon_type`.
The `mapboard_config` table holds project configuration. When files are associated with the project
(currently just the [image mode](/docs/project-management/)), we use the
[SQLite Archive](https://www.sqlite.org/sqlar.html) format to store them
within the application database.

:::caution
It currently isn't possible to open topological tables in QGIS due to library version incompatibility.
This is a [known bug](https://github.com/davenquinn/Mapboard-GIS/issues/1) that we are working to address.

The author of the Spatialite library is due a lot of thanks for creating and maintaining
the core technology that drives this application. Check out the
[Spatialite cookbook](http://www.gaia-gis.it/gaia-sins/spatialite-cookbook/index.html)
to learn more about the library.
