# Project management

<Figure src="/docs/projects/project-list.jpg" width={300} className="right">
  <strong>Mapboard</strong>'s project file list
</Figure>

The main screen of **Mapboard GIS** shows a list of available projects.
Entries in the list correspond to [`mapboard-project` files](/docs/project-file)
in the **Mapboard GIS** documents folder.

Selecting a project in the project list brings up the [map interface](/docs/map-interface)
for that project, which will remain active until the project is closed.

The same set of project files can also be accessed through the **Files** app,
which allows moving, sharing and archiving projects.

  Also note the 18 GB <a href="/docs/basemaps"><code>mbtiles</code> cached basemap</a>! 
</Figure>

When attached to a
computer, Finder (Mac) or iTunes file sharing (Windows) can also be used
for file transfers. This is particularly valuable when transferring large
files such as [basemap imagery](/docs/basemaps).

## Creating new projects

<Figure src="/docs/projects/new-project.jpg" width={300} className="right">
  The project-creation interface
</Figure>

The new project interface allows several categories of new information to be
captured to set up a new mapping project. The top *Project details* section
manages basic metadata.

The *Backend* section allows the selection of the spatial backend.
There are three available backends: the standalone *Spatialite* GIS engine, the tethered
*PostGIS* engine, and the *Image* backend. 

### Choosing a GIS backend

#### Spatialite

The **Spatialite** backend stores geospatial information directly in
a database on the iPad, for easy use in offline scenarios (especially the field). This
backend is mostly feature-complete, but many spatial operations
(especially topology) are relatively slow. This makes it a poor choice for large mapping
projects. Work is ongoing to remove some of these limitations, especially as the
capabilities of iOS devices improve.

#### PostGIS

</Figure>

With the **PostGIS** backend, the application talks to a remote server (usually
on a local network, although in principle internet locations can also be used),
where all spatial operations are handled. This enables faster processing,
data security, and collaborative mapping. See the [tethered mode](/docs/tethered-mode)
documentation for more information.

#### Image

</Figure>


The **Image** backend is a stripped-down version of the
**Spatialite** mode that supports digitization atop a static image in
pixel coordinates. This can help with processes such as annotating field
images.

:::note
Some aspects of the image mode that are currently unwieldy, such as the restriction to
a single image per project, may be addressed in future updates.
[Leave some feedback](/docs/reporting-bugs) if you'd like to suggest improvements.

### Choosing a spatial reference frame

The choice of spatial reference frame is important in all GIS applications, and
**Mapboard GIS** has full support for the wide variety of spatial reference systems
in common use. Reference systems prioritize validity and accuracy for
different use cases and parts of the world (the Spatialite documentation has a good
[primer](https://www.gaia-gis.it/gaia-sins/spatialite-cookbook/html/srid.html)).

The default spatial reference, [SRID `4326`](https://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/4326/),
longitude/latitude relative to the WGS84 datum, is acceptable globally, but using a more
locally-relevant datum can improve the speed and accuracy of GIS calculations. For
instance, a [UTM projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Transverse_Mercator_coordinate_system)
is the standard for many regional and local applications.

We are working on a helper to set the "correct" SRID for typical regional mapping projects.
Currently, if you want a custom spatial reference for a Mapboard project, you must set
the SRID yourself.

## Editing and sharing projects

At the project list, dragging an individual project card to the left exposes
actions for editing, deleting, and exporting that project.

<Figure src="/docs/projects/project-actions.jpg" width={350} className="center">
  Dragging to show project-management actions
</Figure>

- The **Export** button opens a standard iOS *Share Sheet*, allowing
  projects to be copied outside of the app. One common operation
  is to transfer the files to another device with *AirDrop*. This is especially
  useful for quick backups or opening the project in desktop GIS programs.
- The **Edit** button opens the project-creation interface for modifying
  metadata for an existing project. The project's backend cannot be modified,
  with one exception: the server
  URL for a [*PostGIS* tethered backend](/docs/tethered-mode) can be adjusted.
