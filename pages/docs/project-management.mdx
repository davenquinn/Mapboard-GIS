# Project management

<Figure src="/docs/projects/project-list.jpg" width={300} className="left" />

New projects are added to the project list and made available as
[`mapboard-project` files](/docs/project-file) in the **Files** app.
Project files placed in the **Mapboard GIS** documents folder will appear
in the list.

## Creating and editing projects

## Editing and sharing projects

Touching the **Export** button opens a standard iOS "Share Sheet".
This allows projects to be managed and copied. One common operation
is to share the files to another device with "AirDrop". This is especially
useful for quick backups or opening the project in desktop GIS programs.

Project files can also be accessed through the Files app. When attached to a
computer, the Finder (Mac) or iTunes file sharing (Windows) can also be used
for file transfers. This is particularly valuable when transferring large
files such as [basemap imagery](/docs/basemaps).
