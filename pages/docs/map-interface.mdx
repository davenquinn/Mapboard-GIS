# Map interface

The map interface is the core of **Mapboard GIS**. When working within
a project, the map is always available, and interactions with it
follow the active status of the _Mode switcher_. All tool settings
and options are adjusted in the _Sidebar_.

## The edit panel

  <strong>Edit</strong> panel
</Figure>

The edit panel contains settings for the active tools used for drawing,
erasing, and modifying map data. During map editing, this panel will
usually be open. The contents of the edit panel change depending on which
editing mode and feature layer (_Lines_ or _Polygons_) is active.

### _Move_ mode and basic view options

In move mode, map editing is disabled, and _View options_ are
the only controls available. These allow showing and hiding
lines and polygons _en masse_. (Showing and hiding individual types is
handled within the [feature class](/docs/data-types) options.)

The view controls also control an introspection layer for constituent
points of geometries, which is especially handy for debugging topology
errors.

### _Draw mode_ options

Draw mode allows drawing with a stylus (or a finger, if enabled in
the [application settings](/docs/getting-started)).

The drawing panel contains controls to select the active feature class as well as
certainty (which controls the dash pattern for line features).
For the _Lines_ layer, a panel also controls feature snapping; this is replaced
by controls for overlapping features for the _Polygons_ layer.

### _Erase mode_ options

  Erase mode options

In erase mode, a bounding area is used to clip
and/or delete intersecting features.
The primary option available in _Erase_ mode is whether only the
active feature type should be impacted by erasing, or all types.

:::caution
In the _tethered mode_ backed by PostGIS, a _Topological erase_
tool is also available. This tool extends the eraser's area to the
next "node" of the topology. **This feature is experimental and should be used with caution!**

### Selection actions

The _Select mode_ allows features to be gathered using a lasso
to be operated on by more advanced metadata-management functionality.
The operations in this mode allow linework and polygons to be
adjusted after creation.

Many of these operations are experimental and subject to change.

## The settings panel

The **Settings panel** provides access to a range of project
configuration not directly related to editing operations.

The top segment of the panel shows basic, read-only information about the
spatial backend, projection information, and topological tolerance of the project.
The middle segment contains links to settings panels for specific functionality.
The bottom provides debugging operations.
