# Map interface

The map interface is the core of **Mapboard GIS**. When working within
a project, the map is always available, and interactions with it
follow the active status of the _Mode switcher_. All tool settings
and options are adjusted in the _Sidebar_.

## Editing options

<Figure src="/docs/map-interface.jpg">A map interface annotated 
  with functional groupings for the **Edit** panel</Figure>

The edit panel contains settings for the active tools used for drawing,
erasing, and modifying map data. During map editing, this panel will
usually be open. The contents of the edit panel change depending on which
editing mode and feature layer (_Lines_ or _Polygons_) is active.

### _Move_ mode and basic view options

>The view control panel</Figure>

<Figure
  src="/docs/map-interface/show-points.jpg" width={300} className="right"
>Linework showing constituents points</Figure>

In move mode, map editing is disabled, and _View options_ are
the only controls available. These allow showing and hiding
lines and polygons _en masse_. (Showing and hiding individual types is
handled within the [feature class](/docs/data-types) options.)

The view controls also control an introspection layer for constituent
points of geometries, which is especially handy for debugging topology
errors.

### The *Draw* tool

<Figure

  width={250}
  className="right"
>Drawing options</Figure>

Draw mode allows drawing with a stylus (or a finger, if enabled in
the [application settings](/docs/getting-started)).

<Figure
  src="/docs/map-interface/line-certainty.png"
  width={200}
  className="right"
><em>Certainty</em> controls the dash pattern for line features</Figure>

The drawing panel controls selection of the active feature class as well as
certainty.
For the _Lines_ layer, a panel also controls feature snapping; this is replaced
by controls for overlapping features for the _Polygons_ layer.

### The *Erase* tool

<Figure autoPlay loop src="/docs/v3-editing/topological-erase.mp4" type="video/mp4" width={300} className="right">Topological erasing in action</Figure>

<Figure

  width={250}
  className="right"
>Erase mode options</Figure>

In erase mode, a bounding area is used to clip
and/or delete intersecting features. Erasing can
affect only the active feature type, or all types.

A _Topological erase_ tool, which extends
the eraser's effects to the nearest intersection with other
linework, allows quick elimination of dangling edges. <NewFeature version="3.2.0" /> 


### The *Reshape* tool

The **Reshape** edit mode splices new linework
where it crosses current features. This algorithm is fairly complex internally,
and has received extensive optimization to ensure
speed, elegance, and efficiency. <NewFeature version="3.2.0" />

:::note
For now, the reshape tool is only available in for editing lines. Similar results for
polygons can be achieved by using the _Erase_ and _Draw_ tools together.

### Selection actions

  width={250}
  className="right"
/>

The _Select mode_ allows features to be gathered using a lasso
to be operated on by more advanced metadata-management functionality.
The operations in this mode allow linework and polygons to be
adjusted after creation.

Many of these operations are experimental and subject to change.

## The settings panel

<Figure

  width={250}
  className="right"
>The settings sidebar panel</Figure>

The **Settings panel** provides access to a range of project
configuration not directly related to editing operations.

The top segment of the panel shows basic, read-only information about the
spatial backend, projection information, and topological tolerance of the project.
The middle segment contains links to settings panels for specific functionality.
The bottom provides debugging operations.

### Tile layers

The **Tile layers** panel provides tools to add, switch, and modify the basemap
layers that anchor the map.

### Editor settings

<Figure
  src="/docs/map-interface/editor-settings.png"
  width={250}
  className="right"
/>

Some less-important editing settings are
relegated to this panel.

- **Default line width**: sets the line width
  used for features missing the `line_width` property (this generally applies to features collected
  outside of the **Mapboard GIS** environment).
- **Pen base width**: sets the baseline width for the editing pressure curve of
  of the Apple Pencil.
- **Simplify features**: amount of smoothing to apply to captured features (keep low for high precision)

### Topology management

The **Topology** settings panel provides a way to manage the polygon-closing behavior of the map.

## Experimental features

A few experimental features are being developed to improve the map interface.

### Geologic symbols

<Figure

  width={300}
  className="right"
>A fantastical fold-and-thrust belt that showcases geological line symbols.</Figure>

The ability to use context-specific map symbology is one of the key strengths of
paper-based geological mapping. **Mapboard GIS** is experimenting with support for linework
symbols that allow expressive maps that are _ready for interpretation right out of the app_.

We are still working on scaling, so arrows and ticks are generally grossly mis-sized. Still,
you can turn on the experimental symbols in the [application settings panel](/docs). Eventually,
we will also add [geologic patterns for polygon fills](https://davenquinn.com/projects/geologic-patterns/).
