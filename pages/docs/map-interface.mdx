# Map interface

The map interface is the core of **Mapboard GIS**. When working within
a project, the map is always available, and interactions with it
follow the active status of the _Mode switcher_. All tool settings
and options are adjusted in the _Sidebar_.

## Editing options

  <strong>Edit</strong> panel
</Figure>

The edit panel contains settings for the active tools used for drawing,
erasing, and modifying map data. During map editing, this panel will
usually be open. The contents of the edit panel change depending on which
editing mode and feature layer (_Lines_ or _Polygons_) is active.

### _Move_ mode and basic view options

</Figure>

In move mode, map editing is disabled, and _View options_ are
the only controls available. These allow showing and hiding
lines and polygons _en masse_. (Showing and hiding individual types is
handled within the [feature class](/docs/data-types) options.)

The view controls also control an introspection layer for constituent
points of geometries, which is especially handy for debugging topology
errors.

### _Draw mode_ options

  Drawing options
</Figure>

Draw mode allows drawing with a stylus (or a finger, if enabled in
the [application settings](/docs/getting-started)).

The drawing panel contains controls to select the active feature class as well as
certainty (which controls the dash pattern for line features).
For the _Lines_ layer, a panel also controls feature snapping; this is replaced
by controls for overlapping features for the _Polygons_ layer.

### _Erase mode_ options

  Erase mode options
</Figure>

In erase mode, a bounding area is used to clip
and/or delete intersecting features.
The primary option available in _Erase_ mode is whether only the
active feature type should be impacted by erasing, or all types.

:::caution
In the _tethered mode_ backed by PostGIS, a _Topological erase_
tool is also available. This tool extends the eraser's area to the
next "node" of the topology. **This feature is experimental and should be used with caution!**

### Selection actions

/>

The _Select mode_ allows features to be gathered using a lasso
to be operated on by more advanced metadata-management functionality.
The operations in this mode allow linework and polygons to be
adjusted after creation.

Many of these operations are experimental and subject to change.

## The settings panel

The **Settings panel** provides access to a range of project
configuration not directly related to editing operations.

The top segment of the panel shows basic, read-only information about the
spatial backend, projection information, and topological tolerance of the project.
The middle segment contains links to settings panels for specific functionality.
The bottom provides debugging operations.

### Tile layers

The **Tile layers** panel provides tools to add, switch, and modify the basemap
layers that anchor the map.

### Editor settings

  width={280}
  className="right"
/>

Some less-important editing settings are
relegated to this panel.

- **Default line width**: sets the line width
  used for features missing the `line_width` property (this generally applies to features collected
  outside of the **Mapboard GIS** environment).
- **Pen base width**: sets the baseline width for the editing pressure curve of
  of the Apple Pencil.
- **Simplify features**: amount of smoothing to apply to captured features (keep low for high precision)

### Topology management

The **Topology** settings panel provides a way to manage the polygon-closing behavior of the map.

## Experimental features

The map interface contains several experimental features that are potentially
extremely useful for quick, high-fidelity mapping.

### Reshaping linework

<Figure src="/docs/reshaping.mp4" width={400} className="right">

</Figure>

The **Reshape** edit mode is currently only available using the PostGIS tethered backend.
It functions similarly to the basic drawing tool, but it attempts to splice new linework
where it crosses current features. Although this algorithm is fairly complex internally,
the tool is an elegant and time-saving feature. It will migrate to the Spatialite backend
once it reaches stability.

### Geologic symbols

The ability to use context-specific map symbology is one of the key strengths of
paper-based geological mapping. **Mapboard GIS** is experimenting with support for linework
symbols that allow expressive maps that are _ready for interpretation right out of the app_.

We are still working on scaling, so arrows and ticks are generally grossly mis-sized. Still,
you can turn on the experimental symbols in the [application settings panel](/docs). Eventually,
we will also add [geologic patterns for polygon fills](https://davenquinn.com/projects/geologic-patterns/).
