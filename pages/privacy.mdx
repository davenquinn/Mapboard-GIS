# Privacy policy

**Mapboard GIS** is strongly committed to the privacy of its users.
We don't collect or store any personally identifying information.
Although users are asked for their Apple ID to validate their subscription,
this information is managed by Apple and is not seen by us.

On this website, we may collect small amounts of non-identifying information
(e.g. IP address and device info) to help solve technical problems. Likewise, we may
collect anonymized crash logs, device info, etc. for debugging purposes within the
app. This collection stream is maintained by Apple and is stripped of private
information before being sent to us.

We may collect some anonymous information as part of Beta programs, should you choose
to participate. To the extent you submit information that might be personally
identifiable (e.g. app screenshots) through this program or through our public
[Issue Tracker](https://github.com/davenquinn/Mapboard-GIS/tree/master),
we promise not to share it with third parties.
Likewise, if you [contact us](mailto:dev@davenquinn.com), the contents of our communications
may be stored.

Outside of specific debugging scenarios discussed above, **Mapboard GIS** has little need or
interest in your personal data. We are happy to hear from you to discuss how these privacy practices
are practiced.
