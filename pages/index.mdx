**Mapboard GIS** is an iPad mapping system for drawing geospatial
information into a spatial database. It works both in a standalone,
field-ready mode and as a tethered client, with a paired desktop or
laptop handling geospatial operations.

Field geological mapping can be a data-management headache, and capturing high-quality geospatial
information over a large mapping project is tricky.
**Mapboard GIS** allows quick and natural capture of mapping data
into user-defined line and polygon
types using the Apple Pencil, with a process flow comparable to working atop a
paper map. Data are saved to an industry-standard open-source spatial database:
_Spatialite_ in "field" mode or _PostGIS_ a on networked server in "tethered" mode.
Both of these data collections can be opened by standard **QGIS** or **ArcGIS**
desktop GIS software (ArcGIS can only connect to PostGIS in read-only mode); the PostGIS
backend additionally supports advanced collaborative mapping.

Custom tile layers including `MBTiles` files can be loaded
for field-accessible basemaps. Multiple projects can be managed on the same device
and shared with other devices. Mapping can be done in arbitrary spatial reference
systems.

The first public presentation of this work occurred at the virtual GSA 2020.
Here's [the abstract](https://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2020AM/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/359493).
A transcription of the recorded presentation can be found in [this essay](https://davenquinn.com/blog/2020/10/mapboard-gis).
A link to the recorded presentation will be available soon.

## Philosophy

Mapboard GIS strongly follows the philosophy of a single app that does one thing well.


## Testing the app

As of October 2020, the 2.0 release of the app is available for beta testing in preparation for release on the App Store.
If you would like to test the beta version of the app,
head to [TestFlight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/0TfVlWyN) to sign up.
The planned price of the app is $29.99 per year, which will help defray development costs.
The "Full Version" subscription is free in the TestFlight version; just swipe left
to the settings page and click _Purchase full version_.
