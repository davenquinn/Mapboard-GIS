**Mapboard GIS** is an iPad + Apple Pencil app for drawing geologic maps.
It combines the natural editing workflow of pen-and-paper mapping with
the precision, flexibility, and scale-independence of geospatial information
systems (GIS). Its forward-looking design helps beginner and expert
mappers produce multiscale, topologically consistent geologic
maps.

  Mapboard GIS presents a strong vision for how regional geologic
  mapping _should_ work.

# Features

<div className="callout-panel">

<div className="callout">

## Pen-based mapping

**Mapboard GIS** hides its sophisiticated spatial engine behind simple
tools for drawing, erasing, and reshaping features.
Quicker editing allows mapping time to be spent refining interpretation
instead of fighting with technical tools.

## Topology-aware

In typical GIS mapping workflows, contacts are fully digitized prior to
"closing" linework to form unit polygons. The iterative topological
solver within Mapboard GIS allows consistency to be maintained while
during active mapping.

## For the field and lab

**Mapboard GIS** is even more powerful in the office than in the field.
Its *tethered mode*, backed by a PostGIS spatial database on a networked
computer, allows work across massive datasets. When combined with [a server-side
topology solver](https://github.com/davenquinn/PostGIS-Geologic-Map),
the server can maintain topological consistency even during collaborative
mapping!

<div className="callout">

## Open by design

Mapboard GIS conforms to open standards. It is backed by Spatialite and
PostGIS databases, which can be seamlessly read with a wide range of GIS
software. The [server components](https://github.com/davenquinn/mapboard-server)
that drive its *tethered mode* are
simple and open-source, allowing
customized integrations with external GIS systems.

## A focused tool

Mapboard GIS strives to be the best replacement for hand-drawing maps,
and all the attendant map sheets, vellum, and light tables.
Many apps (e.g., StraboSpot, Rockd, FieldMove, and ArcGIS Collector) already provide
capable digital replacements for the field notebook.
Going forward, we hope to build integrations with
other tools for seamless data-collection experiences.

The first public presentation of this work occurred at the virtual GSA 2020.
Here's [the abstract](https://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2020AM/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/359493).
A transcription of the recorded presentation can be found in
[this essay](https://davenquinn.com/blog/2020/10/mapboard-gis).
A link to the recorded presentation will be available soon.


## Testing the app

As of October 2020, the 2.0 release of the app is available for beta testing in preparation for release on the App Store.
If you would like to test the beta version of the app,
head to [TestFlight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/0TfVlWyN) to sign up.
The planned price of the app is $29.99 per year, which will help defray development costs.
The "Full Version" subscription is free in the TestFlight version; just swipe left
to the settings page and click _Purchase full version_.
