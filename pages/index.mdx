**Mapboard GIS** is iPad app for drawing geologic maps, ideally with an Apple
Pencil. It bridges the natural editing workflow of pen-and-paper mapping with
the precision, flexibility, and scale-independence of geospatial information
systems (GIS). Its forward-looking design allows beginner and expert
mappers to produce multiscale, topologically consistent geologic
maps.

  Mapboard GIS presents a strong vision for how mapping _should_ work, in
  response to the inadequacy of both paper and GIS-based workflows
  for regional geologic mapping.

# Features

## Pen-based mapping

Although Mapboard GIS includes a sophisiticated spatial engine, it hides its power and
complexity behind simple tools for drawing, erasing, and reshaping features.
Removing barriers to digitizing allows mappers to iteratively improve their

## Topology-aware

In typical GIS map workflows, map contacts are fully digitized prior to
"closing" linework to form unit polygons. The iterative topological
solver within Mapboard GIS allows consistency to be maintained while
during active mapping.

## For the field and lab

Map production does not end in the field, and Mapboard GIS can serve as a
mapping client in *tethered mode*, alongside the PostGIS spatial database,
allowing work across massive datasets. When combined with the [PostGIS
Geologic Map](https://github.com/davenquinn/PostGIS-Geologic-Map) project,
the server can maintain topological consistency even during collaborative
mapping!

## Open by design

Mapboard GIS conforms to open standards. It saves data into Spatialite and
PostGIS databases, which can be seamlessly read with a wide range of GIS
software. The [server components](https://github.com/davenquinn/mapboard-server)
that drive its *tethered mode* are
simple and open-source, allowing
customized integrations with external GIS systems.

## A focused tool

Mapboard GIS strives to be the best replacement for hand-drawing maps,
and all the attendant map sheets, vellum, and light tables.
Many apps (e.g., StraboSpot, Rockd, FieldMove, and ArcGIS Collector) already provide
capable digital replacements for the field notebook.
Going forward, we hope to build integrations so 
other tools for seamless data-collection experiences.

The first public presentation of this work occurred at the virtual GSA 2020.
Here's [the abstract](https://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2020AM/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/359493).
A transcription of the recorded presentation can be found in
[this essay](https://davenquinn.com/blog/2020/10/mapboard-gis).
A link to the recorded presentation will be available soon.


## Testing the app

As of October 2020, the 2.0 release of the app is available for beta testing in preparation for release on the App Store.
If you would like to test the beta version of the app,
head to [TestFlight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/0TfVlWyN) to sign up.
The planned price of the app is $29.99 per year, which will help defray development costs.
The "Full Version" subscription is free in the TestFlight version; just swipe left
to the settings page and click _Purchase full version_.
