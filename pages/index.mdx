**Mapboard GIS** is an iPad + Apple Pencil app for drawing geologic maps.
It combines the natural editing workflow of pen-and-paper mapping with
the precision, flexibility, and scale-independence of geospatial information
systems (GIS). Its forward-looking design helps beginner and expert
mappers produce multiscale, topologically consistent geologic
maps.

**Mapboard GIS** was born out of frustration with <!--the shortcomings of -->both paper– and GIS-based mapping workflows.

# Features

<div className="callout two-col">

<div>

## Pen-based mapping

**Mapboard GIS** hides its sophisiticated spatial engine behind simple
tools for drawing, erasing, and reshaping features.
Quicker editing allows mapping time to be spent refining interpretations
instead of fighting with technical tools.

## Topology-aware

In current digital mapping workflows, contacts are fully digitized prior to
"closing" linework to form unit polygons. The iterative topological
solver within **Mapboard GIS** painlessly keeps the structure of the map consistent.

## Tether to desktop GIS

Field mapping is important, but **Mapboard GIS** is even more powerful alongside a networked computer.
Its _tethered mode_, backed by a PostGIS spatial database,
allows work across massive datasets.
The [**PostGIS Geologic Map** topology solver](https://github.com/davenquinn/PostGIS-Geologic-Map)
can maintain a consistent map during editing, even during collaborative mapping!

## Open by design

**Mapboard GIS** conforms to open standards. It is backed by Spatialite and
PostGIS databases, which are seamlessly readable by a wide range of GIS
software. The [server components](https://github.com/davenquinn/mapboard-server)
that drive its _tethered mode_ are
simple and open-source, allowing
customized integrations with external GIS systems.

## A focused tool

**Mapboard GIS** strives to bring hand-drawn geologic maps into the digital
age, providing an elegant alternative to its namesake field equipment.
[Many other apps](/about/comparisons) already capably augment
field notebooks, Brünton compasses, and navigational devices. We try not to
reinvent the wheel — but going forward, we hope to integrate with other tools
for seamless data-collection experiences.

# Pricing

**Mapboard GIS** is a powerful tool for field and desktop GIS, developed
by active geoscience researchers. Our $29.99/year **Full Version**
subscription helps defray the cost of development and sustain the project
over time. The demo version is limited to 50 edit operations per day.
