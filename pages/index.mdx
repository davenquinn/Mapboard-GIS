**Mapboard GIS** is an iPad + Apple Pencil app for drawing geologic maps.
It combines the natural editing workflow of pen-and-paper mapping with
the precision, flexibility, and scale-independence of geospatial information
systems (GIS). Its forward-looking design helps beginner and expert
mappers produce multiscale, topologically consistent geologic
maps.

  **Mapboard GIS** was born out of frustration with <!--the shortcomings of -->both paper– and GIS-based mapping workflows.

# Features

<div className="callout two-col">

<div>

## Pen-based mapping

**Mapboard GIS** hides its sophisiticated spatial engine behind simple
tools for drawing, erasing, and reshaping features.
Quicker editing allows mapping time to be spent refining interpretations
instead of fighting with technical tools.

## Topology-aware

In typical GIS mapping workflows, contacts are fully digitized prior to
"closing" linework to form unit polygons. The iterative topological
solver within **Mapboard GIS** keeps the structure of the map consistent
as mapping progresses.

## Even better in the office

Field mapping is important, but **Mapboard GIS** is even more powerful alongside a networked computer.
Its *tethered mode*, backed by a PostGIS spatial database,
allows work across massive datasets. A companion [server-side
topology solver](https://github.com/davenquinn/PostGIS-Geologic-Map) can
maintain topological consistency during collaborative
mapping!

## Open by design

**Mapboard GIS** conforms to open standards. It is backed by Spatialite and
PostGIS databases, which can be seamlessly read with a wide range of GIS
software. The [server components](https://github.com/davenquinn/mapboard-server)
that drive its *tethered mode* are
simple and open-source, allowing
customized integrations with external GIS systems.

## A focused tool

**Mapboard GIS** strives to bring hand-drawn geologic maps into the digital age, replacing
its namesake tool.
[Many other apps](/comparisons) already provide
capable digital replacements for the field notebook, Brunton compass, and navigational
devices. We try not to reinvent the wheel — but going forward, we hope to integrate
with other tools for seamless data-collection experiences.

The first public presentation of this work occurred at the virtual GSA 2020.
Here's [the abstract](https://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2020AM/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/359493).
A transcription of the recorded presentation can be found in
[this essay](https://davenquinn.com/blog/2020/10/mapboard-gis).
A link to the recorded presentation will be available soon.


## Testing the app

As of October 2020, the 2.0 release of the app is available for beta testing in preparation for release on the App Store.
If you would like to test the beta version of the app,
head to [TestFlight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/0TfVlWyN) to sign up.
The planned price of the app is $29.99 per year, which will help defray development costs.
The "Full Version" subscription is free in the TestFlight version; just swipe left
to the settings page and click _Purchase full version_.
