Mapboard GIS is an application for drawing geologic maps on an iPad tablet
computer, ideally with an Apple Pencil. It bridges the natural editing
workflow of pen-and-paper mapping with the precision and scale-independence
of GIS systems. It is designed to allow both beginner and expert mappers to
produce precise, multiscale, and topologically consistent geologic maps.

## Pen-based editing

Mapboard GIS includes a sophisiticated spatial engine, but hides its power and
complexity behind simple tools for drawing, erasing, and reshaping features.
Removing barriers to digitizing allows mapping energy to be concentrated on
improving features

## Powerful modes for the field and lab

Map production does not end in the field, and drawing is still the best way to
capture lines 

## Topology-aware

## Open by design

Mapboard GIS is not open-source software

## A focused tool

Mapboard GIS strives to be the best replacement for hand-drawing maps,
map sheets, vellum, light tables, and all that jazz.
Many apps (e.g., StraboSpot, Rockd, FieldMove, and ArcGIS Collector) already provide
capable digital replacements for the field notebook.
Going forward, we hope to build integrations so 
other tools for seamless data-collection experiences.

The first public presentation of this work occurred at the virtual GSA 2020.
Here's [the abstract](https://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2020AM/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/359493).
A transcription of the recorded presentation can be found in
[this essay](https://davenquinn.com/blog/2020/10/mapboard-gis).
A link to the recorded presentation will be available soon.


## Testing the app

As of October 2020, the 2.0 release of the app is available for beta testing in preparation for release on the App Store.
If you would like to test the beta version of the app,
head to [TestFlight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/0TfVlWyN) to sign up.
The planned price of the app is $29.99 per year, which will help defray development costs.
The "Full Version" subscription is free in the TestFlight version; just swipe left
to the settings page and click _Purchase full version_.



## Upcoming features

- A project initialization user interface that guides the user towards appropriate map projections

### Education-focused features

- Guidance on appropriate map projections
- Modes to predefine map area and allowed scale range for digitizing

- Integrations with Macrostrat
- Integrations of better mapping symbology (e.g. patterns)
