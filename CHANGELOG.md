## [**Version `4.0.1`**](/iOS-releases/version-4.0.1.md) â€” *February 23, 2024*


## Bug fixes and user-interface improvements

- Fix a major bug ([#15](https://github.com/davenquinn/Mapboard-GIS/issues/15)) that caused the app to crash when opening a project


## [**Version `4.0.0`**](/iOS-releases/version-4.0.0.md) â€” *December 14, 2023*


## Layer-based editing

Editing by map layer is extremely useful for capturing overlapping map features
(for instance, "bedrock geology" and "surficial geology" layers).
But it can be used to separate any features that you want to edit
independently.

- Separate layers of mapping that can be independently edited
- Snapping improvements for individual map layers
- Layer reordering

Going forward, this feature will underpin a handling of more complex types of
map data (e.g., notes, point-based sample data, etc.) atop the current topological map.

:::caution

While layer-based editing is functional, some features are still in development and will be released in subsequent versions:

- Layer-based topology management
- Layer deletion
- Layer show/hide
- Layer-specific line/polygon types

:::

## New project creation workflow

- New control to set map area
- Suggests the best projection (UTM zones or WGS84 lat lon) for your mapping area

## User interface improvements

- New visualizations of "in-progress edits"
- New controls: **Zoom to map area**, **Reload map**
- First steps towards reworking Projects page
- New selection functions: **Change layer**

## Performance and internal fixes

- Fixes to topology engine to not delete straight lines
- Fixed CPU leak from map event handlers
- More modern internal map server
- Slightly more efficient map queries
- Improved server-linked mapping mode
- Internal handling of point data sources
- Fixes for several bugs with MBTiles layers


## [**Version `3.3.3`**](/iOS-releases/version-3.3.3.md) â€” *April 11, 2023*


- Greatly improved the layout of UI controls, especially when considering device rotation
- Return to packaged projects (i.e., `.mapboard-project` file is a directory)
  in order to hide SQLite temporary files and improve interoperability
  with projects stored outside of the application directory.
- Initial steps towards QField compatibility (more on that later).
- Improved SwiftUI code generally


## [**Version `3.3.2`**](/iOS-releases/version-3.3.2.md) â€” *January 24, 2023*


This release is a quick fix for several issues:

- A major regression that prevented the creation of new projects
- Make _3D Terrain_ the default setting to combat the lack of a functional "map idle"
  event when terrain is off.
- Fix a bug that prevented creation and editing of data types
- Several tiny bug fixes to map layout


## [**Version `3.3.1`**](/iOS-releases/version-3.3.1.md) â€” *January 24, 2023*


This release includes bugfixes atop [Version `3.3.0`](/docs/ios/releases/3.3.0),
focused on providing a smoother editing experience for large feature datasets.

### Bug fixes

- Refactor many synchronous database writes, which block the user interface causing stuttering
- Fix error that prevented access to select panel
- Make some feature queries much faster through better spatial indexing
- Improve the sequencing of editing actions and topology updates, cancelling in-progress
  topology solving when new features are added. "Continuous topology" mode now has minimal
  negative effects on the editing experience (although it does still take a lot of battery power).
- Fix bug that prevented editing after device is rotated to portrait mode
- Reduce unnecessary work upon a "cold start" of the app


## [**Version `3.3.0`**](/iOS-releases/version-3.3.0.md) â€” *January 22, 2023*

*This is a major release.* ðŸŽ‰


This release builds atop the strong base established just a few weeks ago with the public release of **Version 3**.
Here, we shift focus from restructuring the app's internals
towards adding several long-awaited features.

![Multi-perspective mapping atop 3D terrain](/docs/v3-editing/3d-mapping.mp4)

### Mapping atop 3D terrain

![Portrait user interface, experimental globe, and fast multiscale editing of large datasets](/docs/v3-editing/vertical-zoom.mp4)

We have added a new 3D terrain mode, allowing stunning new capabilities for multi-view mapping.
This system is based on Mapbox's fantastic new [Maps SDK](https://docs.mapbox.com/ios/maps/guides/).
This functionality was simple to add and performs amazingly well â€” Mapbox engineers deserve huge congratulations
for making this possible.
Right now, the only available DEM is Mapbox's [`terrain-dem-v1` tileset](https://docs.mapbox.com/data/tilesets/reference/mapbox-terrain-dem-v1/), but this may change in the future.

### User interface rotation

Since its inception, **Mapboard GIS** has only been usable in landscape mode,
due to the complexity of building an automatically-rescaling user interface.
This limitation has finally been removed. The sidebar is now a floating panel,
and the app can be freely rotated.

### Map movement while editing

When editing with a stylus, it is often useful to reposition the map between
edits. However, touch types have proven difficult to separate. We've finally
removed this limitation, allowing easier map movement in all editing modes.

:::note
If desired, separation between _Move_ and edit modes can be restored in **Project Settings**
:::

### Tile overlay improvements

- A bug with loading map overlays were fixed, leading to
  a more predictable experience when basemaps are loaded.
- More layer visibility settings were made persistent
- New warning messages were added for invalid MBTiles datasets and
  those missing overviews.
- The zoom range over which underscaled map overlays show up has
  been increased.

### User interface improvements

We made a ton of small improvements to the user interface:

- Ensure the compass is never hidden behind the sidebar
- Rearrange some settings for clarity
- Make some forms more space-efficient
- Make snap panel visible in _Reshape_ mode
- Hide _Reshape_ tool for polygon editing
- Add a scalebar
- Add an experimental globe mode
- Improve map loading indicators
- Fix a small error in reported map scale
- Disable map pitch when 3D mode is disabled

### Editing bug fixes

We fixed many small bugs with editing features:

- Fix snapping behavior for multipart lines
- Improved _Topological erase_ tool to more correctly find
  intersections; partial fix for repetition of lines.
- Fix reshaping of multipart features
- Fixes for larger datasets in Spatialite:
  - Much quicker internal implementation for snapping
  - Automatically split large features by number of
    vertices for efficiency
- Improve continuous update mode for topology (although
  this still has a few notable bugs).
- Improvements to internal threading model

Now that the hard work of upgrading the fundamentals is done,
we're excited to be moving forward at a faster clip!


## [**Version `3.2.0`**](/iOS-releases/version-3.2.0.md) â€” *January 4, 2023*

*This is a major release.* ðŸŽ‰


![The upgraded topology engine in action](/docs/v3-editing/topology.mp4)

This is the first public release of **Mapboard GIS** _Version 3_.
It is a major rework of the app's internals and spatial editing capabilities,
in preparation for coming functional enhancements.

### New editing tools

![Drawing and reshaping lines](/docs/v3-editing/editing-tools.mp4)

- Line snapping has been improved to also snap
  current linework endpoints to nearby created
  and reshaped lines
- A new **Reshape** tool allows rapid iteration
  of linework
- **Topological erasing** allows trimming of
  dangling edges
- A greatly improved **Undo** tool allows full recovery from any line or polygon change.

![Reshape and undo](/docs/v3-editing/reshape-undo.mp4)

![Topological erase mode](/docs/v3-editing/topological-erase.mp4)

### An improved topology system

The onboard topology engine has been improved for stability, performance, and effectiveness.
Although it is still somewhat brittle, it now allows rapid and high-quality iterative solving in many cases.

### An updated map canvas

The mapping user interface has been greatly improved to transition
from Mapbox's legacy iOS SDK to the newer
[Mapbox Maps SDK for iOS](https://docs.mapbox.com/ios/maps/guides/).
This required significant retooling of the app's backend data flows
and structures, including with an internal vector tile

### Upgraded spatial stack

The stack of spatial software that powers **Mapboard GIS** has been greatly
enhanced in _Version 3_. This includes updated versions of `proj`, `geos`,
`spatialite`, `rttopo`, and other supporting open-source geospatial libraries.
We've also greatly enhanced the compilation pipeline for these libraries to be
less brittle and enable more direct utilization of their functionality.

:::caution

### Missing `v2` functionality

This is a major overhaul of the app, and some features have not yet
been completely reimplemented using new patterns. We anticipate fixing many problems
and omissions in future minor versions in the `3.x` series.

Key missing pieces:

- Planetary projections are harder with `libproj` versions greater than 4, and have not been validated in the current version
- Server connections with PostGIS need major upgrades and currently don't work.
  :::


## [**Version `3.1.0`**](/iOS-releases/version-3.1.0.md) â€” *December 28, 2022*

*This is a pre-release.*


### Small user-interface changes

- Fixed demo counter views
- Fix some small UI bugs with map interface

### Purchase handling

- Fixed handling of in-app purchases (for **Full version** subscription)
- Fixed rate limiting of edits in demo mode

### Editing tool fixes

Revamped the _Reshape_ and _New line_ tools for more cohesive snapping
behavior.

### Layer filtering

- Restored show/hide and filter-by-type capabilities for line and polygon layers.
- Filtering behavior now prevents lines from being erased and modified when
  the layer is not shown.

:::caution
Features are still modified for hidden layers when in _Topological_ or _All_ editing modes.
This behavior needs to be improved, probably by overriding filtering settings when in
these edit modes, or removing filtering options altogether in favor of a more advanced
"layers" system.
:::


## [**Version `3.0.0`**](/iOS-releases/version-3.0.0.md) â€” *Unreleased*

*This is a pre-release.*


- Completely revamped mapping system based on Mapbox Maps SDK v10
- Fixes to editing tools and map views
- New vector tile rendering pipeline
- Upgraded GIS software libraries


## [**Version `2.3.0`**](/iOS-releases/version-2.3.0.md) â€” *November 27, 2021*


### Offline access to Mapbox tile layers

Added a user interface for creating and managing Mapbox GL offline tile packs.
This currently has a very basic user interface, but it allows Mapbox-provided basemaps
to be used effectively in the field.

### Bugfixes

- Fixed a bug with the control panel for creating tile layers from external URLs
- Fixed some minor display bugs

## [**Version `2.2.4`**](/iOS-releases/version-2.2.4.md) â€” *April 18, 2021*


### Better raster-tile layer support

- Improvements and bugfixes for input forms
- Ability to specify tileset parameters (tile size and scheme)

Tilesets should now be specified using a [TileJSON `tiles` spec](https://github.com/mapbox/tilejson-spec/tree/master/2.2.0), e.g. `https://example.com/tiles/{z}/{x}/{y}.png`

### Project reprojection

**Spatialite** projects can be reprojected from the **Edit project** form by specifying a new SRID. All features will be rewritten, so use this capability with caution!

### Planetary use

Better support for planetary (non-Earth) use by providing a pathway to add custom coordinate systems.
Coordinate systems must be added to the `spatial_ref_sys` table in an external SQLite browser.

Add an optional `spheroid_radius` project configuration setting to adapt map scale reporting to different planetary bodies.
This configuration must be added directly to the project file, as such:

```
INSERT INTO mapboard_config
VALUES ('spheriod_radius', 3396190);
```


## [**Version `2.2.3`**](/iOS-releases/version-2.2.3.md) â€” *March 20, 2021*


### Initial public App Store release! ðŸŽ‰

See the [release announcement](https://davenquinn.com/blog/2021/3/mapboard-gis-released)
for more information!

- Added some links
- Small optimizations


## [**Version `2.2.0`**](/iOS-releases/version-2.2.0.md) â€” *March 18, 2021*

*This is a pre-release.*


- Fixed prerelease bugs
- Make line certainty control dash pattern
- Add experimental geological symbols
- `.mapboard-project` files are now bare SQLite databases rather than packages.
  This allows direct opening in GIS software and database browsers.
- Many small UI fixes
- Deduplicated some frameworks


## [**Version `2.1.0`**](/iOS-releases/version-2.1.0.md) â€” *November 26, 2020*

*This is a pre-release.*


### Changed

- Added the ability to show vertices and endpoints of the line layer (to diagnose topology problems)
- Added topology polygon layer that uses the same display interfaces as
  the line and polygon layers. This takes advances made for the onboard Spatialite
  backend and generalizes them to work with the PostGIS backend as well.
  Using this functionality requires shifting to the Version 2 series of
  the `mapboard-server` project.


## [**Version `2.0.1`**](/iOS-releases/version-2.0.1.md) â€” *October 28, 2020*

*This is a pre-release.*


### Fixes

- Fixed showing and hiding of map layers and data types
- More functional topology control panel, now accessible
  directly from the polygons panel.


## [**Version `2.0.0`**](/iOS-releases/version-2.0.0.md) â€” *October 19, 2020*

*This is a pre-release.*


### Added

- New topology mode for Spatialite backend

### Changed

- User interface rewritten in SwiftUI
- Moved to **Mapbox GL** for mapping backend


## [**Version `1.0.0`**](/iOS-releases/version-1.0.0.md) â€” *2018â€“2020*

*This is a pre-release.*


The 1.0 series of Mapboard GIS was the initial release for internal use. It supported
basic field mapping functionality, such as `mbtiles` basemaps and the
onboard Spatialite GIS backend.
