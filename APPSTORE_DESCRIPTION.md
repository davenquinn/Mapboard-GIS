Mapboard GIS is an iPad app for drawing geologic maps with an Apple Pencil.
It combines the natural editing workflow of pen-and-paper mapping with
the precision, flexibility, and scale-independence of geospatial information
systems (GIS). Its forward-looking design helps beginner and expert
mappers produce multiscale, topologically consistent geologic
maps.

MOTIVATION AND DESIGN

Mapboard GIS was born out of frustration with both paperâ€“ and GIS-based mapping workflows.
It attempts to bring digital mapping workflows closer to the process of working with paper maps.
It hides a sophisiticated spatial engine behind simple
tools for drawing, erasing, and reshaping features.
This mapping time to be spent refining interpretations
instead of fighting with technical tools.

KEY FEATURES

- Simple but powerful editing tools geared towards pen-based mapping
- Powerful and configurable feature snapping and erasing
- Sophisticated onboard Spatialite engine
- Iterative topology solver to fill map units
- Direct Spatialite geodatabase export (openable in QGIS, ArcGIS, etc.)
- Tether to remote PostGIS for work across large datasets and real-time collaboration
- User-configurable data types for line and polygon features
- Interoperable with standard formats (mbtiles, Spatialite, PostGIS)
  and open-source + commercial software

OTHER FEATURES

- Load MBTiles basemaps
- Satellite, streets, and topographic basemaps
- Dark mode support
- Geologic line types
