This is the public issue tracking repository for the **Mapboard GIS** iPad app,
which is a new generation of user interface for drawing geologic maps.
It was created to support the research of [Daven Quinn](https://davenquinn.com)
and the [Macrostrat](https://macrostrat.org) group.

If you're having trouble using the app, [**create an issue**](https://github.com/davenquinn/Mapboard-GIS/issues)
